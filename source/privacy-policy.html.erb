      <p class="lead">
        At some point, I should make the effort to find a suitable privacy
        policy, but in the meantime I thought I'd be clear on what my
        intentions are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="lead">
            Any personal information I collect from you &ndash; including, but
            not limited to names, email addresses, questionnaire answers, and
            personal emails &ndash; will only be used by Wossname Industries
            for the express purpose of providing you with whatever service
            we're offering you. In particular, I will <strong>not</strong> pass
            on any personally identifiable information (e.g. your name and/or
            email address) to any third parties without your express
            permission.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p class="lead">
            I may aggregate information collected across a cohort of users, and
            share that aggregate data with others. I'll only do so if I've got
            a good business reason for it. (For example, if I'm talking to a
            publisher about this book, I may share the number of mailing list
            subscribers in order to demonstrate that there's an audience
            demanding it be written! Or perhaps I'm talking to an investor
            about helping me to fund growth in The Happiness Project, and I
            want to show the improvement in happiness that existing users have
            achieved.)
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p class="lead">
            I do use a number of third party services to run the business, and
            your data is stored with some of them. In particular, right now,
            I'm using <%= link_to 'Intercom', 'https://www.intercom.io/' %> for
            handling email, <%= link_to 'Mailchimp', 'http://eepurl.com/bOLGs1' %>
            for mailing lists, and <%= link_to 'Typeform', 'http://ssqt.co/EjgT' %>
            for questionnaires. I'm pretty confident that they're not going to
            do anything evil with your data and I'm pretty careful about having
            strong passwords, and two-factor authentication enabled, so my
            accounts should be secure enough.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="lead">
        That's pretty much all I've got to say on privacy right now! If you've
        got any questions at all, please feel free to get in touch. You can
        send me a message by clicking the wee chat bubble in the bottom right
        hand corner (that's Intercom at work!), or by sending me an email, to
        <%= mail_to_link subject: 'I have a question about privacy' %>.
