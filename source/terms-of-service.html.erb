        I really haven't thought through what a terms of service ought to look
        like yet, and I probably ought not to be worrying about it just yet. As
        a stopgap measure, please realise that it's just one person (Graeme)
        who's behind all this. I'm doing my best, but I do have other
        commitments, other projects, and a life. I like to have a balance
        across all these things! So what I really mean to say is that service
        is offered on a best-effort basis. If there's anything particularly
        time-critical, or you'd be upset if the service went offline, you
        really want to talk to me about it!

        Does that make sense? If not, shoot me an email, to
        <%= mail_to_link subject: 'I have a question about Terms of Service' %>,
        and we can talk it through.
