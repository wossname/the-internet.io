      I haven’t done any interviewing for a while but I went through a
      period of growth in one of the companies I worked for where we were
      feverishly expanding the development team, so we had to be a little
      more systematic in our approach to interviewing. Instead of just
      having an open conversation with candidates to see where it led
      (which is what I’d previously done in such situations), I wound up
      preparing a ‘standard’ set of questions. It took a few goes, but
      eventually I settled on a favourite question for the technical
      portion of the interview:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        When I pull up my favourite Internet browser, type “google.com”
        into the address bar, and press return, what happens?
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      I reckon it’s a doozy of a technical question. There’s so much
      breadth and depth in that answer. Let's dig into it a bit
      more&hellip;

      I gave a lightning talk at the Bath Ruby Conference on how domain names
      are resolved. Trying to pack 100ms of network chatter into 5 minutes
      proved tricky!
